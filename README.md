Welcome to our blog. 

In order to get the website up and running please do the following: 

1. In a terminal with the directory set to the project folder (in VS Code or Git gui) run the npm install command to obtain the necessary packages 

2. When npm has finished installing run the command 'node app.js' to start the server. 

3. In a web browser, type localhost:3000 to get to the home page. 

4. If you would like to login with one of our existing details, please click ‘Sign in’ button and login with the following details:
        Username: welcome
        Password: 12345
	
5. Otherwise, please create a new account by clicking ‘sign-up’.

6. If you get below error in the terminal when you try to reset your password, it is due to the firewall issue. Please try resending the email again and it should work in the second time.
